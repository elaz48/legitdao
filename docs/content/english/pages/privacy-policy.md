#### Commitment to Open Source Collaboration Under the MIT License
LegitDAO operates as an open-source project under the MIT License, which allows contributors to share their code freely while ensuring that any contributions made to the project remain open and accessible. When contributors push a pull request to the LegitDAO GitHub repository, they acknowledge that their code will be released under the same MIT License. This commitment fosters a collaborative environment where developers can contribute their expertise, enhance the project's functionality, and promote transparency. By adhering to an open-source model, LegitDAO not only encourages innovation but also empowers a diverse community of contributors to participate in the development of the project.

#### Transparency and Regular Updates to the Privacy Policy
In line with the principles of transparency and community engagement, LegitDAO commits to regularly updating its privacy policy document whenever the project evolves. Each update will include new sections that provide clarity on specific matters related to privacy and data handling. To keep the community informed, these changes will be documented in the [changelog](/changelog), with annotations at the bottom of the privacy policy page outlining the specific modifications made. This systematic approach ensures that contributors and users are aware of any adjustments, fostering trust and accountability within the LegitDAO community.
