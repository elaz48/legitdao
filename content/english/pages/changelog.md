The changelog serves as a comprehensive record of all updates made to the LegitDAO ecosystem. Whenever an individual implements an update, they must create an entry in the changelog to detail the changes they made. These modifications may include alterations to the source code, marketing initiatives carried out on behalf of the DAO, articles written on external websites, or any other contributions aimed at furthering LegitDAO’s mission of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). This systematic documentation ensures transparency and accountability within the community, allowing everyone to stay informed about the ongoing progress and efforts toward achieving the project’s goals.

An entry is added for each day that there is a modification in the LegitDAO ecosystem. The individual making the modification should include their name along with the details of the change in the section for the current day. If a section for the current day does not exist, the person making the modification is responsible for creating one.
