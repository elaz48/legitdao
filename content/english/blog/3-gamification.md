In a world where connection and collaboration are paramount, the quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a monumental leap forward for humanity. At LegitDAO, we envision a future where people can easily connect, propose ideas, and execute projects to pave the way for our AGI ambitions. This vision is not just a dream; it’s a roadmap leading us toward a reality where an AGI operates within a well-interconnected blockchain ecosystem.

## A Glimpse into the Future
Our journey begins with a captivating science fiction narrative that unfolds a thousand years from now, exploring a world that is not only advanced but intricately linked to the present. This world will be governed by an AGI, serving as a central figure that orchestrates the interactions and transactions among its inhabitants. By crafting this narrative, we aim to guide our current timeline, helping us execute our mission and providing insights into the possibilities that lie ahead.

The book, which we are set to release soon, acts as a bridge connecting our current endeavors with the envisioned future. The storyline will illustrate how our actions today can influence and alter the future, creating a dynamic relationship between the past, present, and future. When projects are executed within LegitDAO, they won’t just exist in isolation; they will ripple through time, affecting the future and shaping the world we imagine.

## The Role of LegitDAO
LegitDAO serves as a platform for collaboration, encouraging community members to propose and execute projects. Every initiative undertaken has the potential to modify the future world depicted in our narrative, creating a real-time feedback loop between the actions we take today and the consequences they yield in the future.

By participating in LegitDAO, contributors are not merely working on individual projects; they are engaging in a larger mission that contributes to the advancement of AGI. This approach fosters a sense of purpose and community, as every member's effort is connected to the broader goal of developing an intelligent system that can enhance human life.

## Gamifying the Experience
Our vision extends beyond the book; we are excited to announce the development of a massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that will be integrated into our decentralized ecosystem. In this game, the actions players take in LegitDAO will have direct implications for their experience in the virtual world.

When individuals propose and successfully execute projects within LegitDAO, they will not only contribute to AGI development and make revenue from their contributions in real life but also unlock wealth and resources for their in-game guilds. This dual benefit creates an engaging gameplay experience where real-world contributions translate into virtual rewards. The gamification of our ecosystem is designed to maintain long-term engagement and foster a community of passionate supporters who find joy in both the game and the underlying mission of LegitDAO.

## A Sustainable Ecosystem
To ensure the sustainability of our initiatives, we will implement a fair and transparent economic model. Upon the physicial book's release, 10% of the sales will support LegitDAO, while 15% will fund our referral system, encouraging community growth. The remaining 75% will go directly to the author, ensuring that their creative efforts are rewarded. This model not only supports the author but also creates a system where the community benefits from the success of the narrative.

Furthermore, the copyright of the book will be retained by its author, fostering an environment of creativity and ownership. As soon as the smart contract is deployed, the initial contract of the book will be proposed within LegitDAO, allowing community members to vote on its terms. This democratic approach reinforces our commitment to transparency and collaboration.

## Launching Our Vision
We are excited to announce that the online version of the book and its dedicated website will be launched within a week. By making the book freely available to read online, we aim to build a substantial newsletter that will not only promote the captivating story but also serve as a platform to elevate LegitDAO’s visibility.

As we embark on this journey, we invite you to join us in shaping the future. The narrative we create will not only entertain but also inspire action, encouraging readers to participate in the LegitDAO ecosystem. Together, we will explore the uncharted territories of AGI, weaving a narrative that is as compelling as it is transformative.

## Conclusion
At LegitDAO, our mission is clear: to connect people, facilitate collaboration, and harness the power of collective intelligence to achieve our AGI objectives. Through storytelling, gaming, and community engagement, we are laying the groundwork for a future where an AGI enriches our lives and enhances our capabilities.

As we release our book and embark on the development of our MMORPG, we are not just building a project; we are creating a movement. A movement that invites you to participate, to dream, and to shape the future alongside us. Together, let’s explore the possibilities and build a world where our visions of AGI can thrive.
