LegitDAO aims to harness existing open-source projects and develop new tools to create artificial general intelligence (AGI). This ambitious goal invites contributions from anyone interested in shaping the future of technology. To facilitate this, LegitDAO allows individuals to submit proposals that detail their ideas and suggestions. Each proposal is recorded on a blockchain, ensuring that it is immutable and transparent. Once submitted, proposals are put to a vote among LegitDAO token holders, allowing the community to have a direct say in the development process.

Proposals can cover a wide range of topics, including tool development, management services, marketing strategies, and other initiatives that can help propel LegitDAO toward its mission. This inclusive approach fosters collaboration and innovation within the community, as diverse perspectives and skills come together to tackle complex challenges.

In the upcoming update, we will introduce features that enable users to easily submit new proposals, vote on submitted ideas, and track the outcomes of both successful and unsuccessful proposals. This enhancement will further engage our community and streamline the decision-making process. Stay tuned!
